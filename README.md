# Cabana-Joe-Hospitality-Products

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to modify the functionality of the Cabana Joe's Hospitality Products webpage. Currently, 
the Website has no on-line store functionality and is coming soon. Our group took on the development of an online store with complete functionality. 
The client is able to purchase products from our newly designed website as well as receive confirmation of their purchase. When purchasing a new product, the client will also be prompted to enter payment information. At this point, the program will be utilizing stripe.  Stripe is a suite of payment APIs that powers commerce for online businesses of all sizes.
